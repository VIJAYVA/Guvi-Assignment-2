How does the browser actually render a website:

1)When a web page is loaded, the browser first reads the HTML text and constructs DOM Tree from it. 
2)Then it processes the CSS whether that is inline, embedded, or external CSS and constructs the CSSOM Tree from it. 
3)After these trees are constructed, then it constructs the Render-Tree from it.
4)process used in web development that turns website code into the interactive pages users see when they visit a website.
5)The term generally refers to the use of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript codes.
